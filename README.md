# Kawasaki-ShCodes-Basic-Project
My first project with SheCodes Basic. The task was to create a simple landing page from scratch of something I am passionate about. 
It's a single-page website about one of my favorite motorcycles, Kawasaki Ninja 250r. It was built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
